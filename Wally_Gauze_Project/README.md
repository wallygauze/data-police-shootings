#### POLICE SHOOTINGS IN THE US - Order and chaos

WHAT IS HAPPENING?

---

This folder contains my (Wally Gauze) own research on the US police shootings, mainly based on this dataset from the Washington Post. This was started as my capstone project for the Data Science Immersive course of General Assembly.
I include the version of the report as per the end of the course.
