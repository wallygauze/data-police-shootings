This folder contains my (Wally Gauze) own research on the US police shootings, mainly based on this dataset. This was started as my capstone project for the Data Science Immersive course of General Assembly, and prolonged afterwards.
I include the version of the report as per the end of the course.

### Table of contents


- __Approach__

- __Goals__

__I) Goal : modifying & creating variables when needed (using NLP if needed) to organize the data with the factors suggesting criminality__

- - About the variables

- __Data Acquisition__
- - Identifying cases where unarmed victims were likely to be suspects of previous violent crime
- - - Basic information retrieval based on keywords

__II) Goal: uncover insights in the killings with unsupervised techniques__

- __2015 to 2016 (excl. December) difference (basic descriptive enquiry)__

- __Race profile for these groups (basic descriptive enquiry)__
- - Results
- - Discussion

- __Hierarchical Clustering__
- - Data transformation
- - Forming linkage matrix
- - What clusters do we have?
- - Discussion
- - - A more representative dissimilarity metric?

__III) Supervised part: Are higher relative numbers of killings mostly correlated to the levels of violent crime?__

- - Standardising Police Shootings
- - Distribution of variables
- - Scatter plot with total violence explaining police shootings
- - Statistical Correlation
- - Models
- - Results
- - Discussion
