WHAT IS HAPPENING?

This folder contains my (Wally Gauze) own research on the US police shootings, mainly based on this dataset. This was started as my capstone project for the Data Science Immersive course of General Assembly, and prolonged afterwards.
I include the version of the report as per the end of the course.
