In a letter sent to Vargas that he read aloud from Wednesday, the ACLU charged that investigators are spending too much time examining Zambrano-Montes\\u2019s activities before he was shot, rather than the training the officers received before firing in an intersection where several cars had parked and customers filled local businesses.\\n         \\n         \\n         \\u201cThis line of inquiry makes it appear that (investigators are) looking for ways to discredit Mr. Zambrano based on any problems he may have faced in his past, instead of ascertaining the facts about the officers\\u2019 knowledge at the time of the shooting,\\u201d the letter reads.\\n         \\n         \\n         Public protests in Pasco have remained peaceful, but well-attended. On Saturday, demonstrators marched from the site of the shooting to the Pasco police station then across a cable bridge connecting Pasco to Kennewick, halting traffic.\\n         \\n         \\n         A makeshift memorial has sprung up at the site where Zambrano-Montes was shot, with posterboard signs and messages written on the sidewalk in chalk condemning the officers in English and Spanish. Several Christ candles and balloons also have been left there.\\n         \\n         \\n         Outside Pasco City Hall, Lorian Reavely waved at passing police cars and pedestrians seated near a sign asking to stop police brutality. Reavely, who\\u2019s lived in Pasco since 1987, said she and her husband were thrown into action by the amateur video of the shooting, which shows an initial volley of gunfire, then a chase down the sidewalk before Zambrano-Montes turns and is shot by officers.\\n         \\n         \\n         \\u201cPeople are still paying attention here,\\u201d Reavely said, as a couple drove up in an SUV and handed her juice with their thanks. \\u201cWe\\u2019ve had a lot of community support.\\u201d\\n         \\n         \\n         Reavely said the demonstrations by Pasco residents have not been about Zambrano alone. Local authorities have shot and killed five men since last summer, evidence that change is needed in training, she said.\\n         \\n         \\n         \\u201cWhen I was growing up, there were no police shootings,\\u201d she said. Activists plan another march Saturday in the city.\\n         \\n         \\n         Vargas, the business leader seeking federal intervention, said his group intends to look to Spokane activism as a model for attracting federal review in Pasco. The U.S. Justice Department recently released its recommendations for the Spokane Police Department, a review launched as a result of the conviction of police officer in the Otto Zehm case. Zehm died in 2006 in police custody.\\n         \\n         \\n         The community also has rallied to support at least one business owner affected by the shooting. Residents started an online campaign to raise money for the owner of Vinny\\u2019s Cafe and Bakery, a shop just feet from where Zambrano-Montes was killed that recently opened its doors and has faced declining business in the aftermath.\\n         \\n         \\n         The shop has raised $2,200 online, and more visitors stopped in Wednesday morning to leave an extra large tip or donation in Vinicio Gomez\\u2019s till. Among those were Patricia Franz and Darlene Petty, who stopped in for lunch on a break from their work at a local soup kitchen.\\n         \\n         \\n         \\u201cIt\\u2019s great to see the community coming together to support this,\\u201d Petty said.\\n         \\n         \\n         As the funeral procession fanned out Wednesday, friends and family members embracing Montes Rivera and others wiping away their tears, a donation box was handed around. Leona Michael Garcia Espinoza stepped forward and dropped a few dollars in, saying she\\u2019s seen too much recent violence by law enforcement.\\n         \\n         \\n         \\u201cThis has got to stop,\\u201d she said. \\u201cThis is not justice.\\u201d\\n         \\n         \\n         \\n         \\n         \\n         \\n         \\n         \\n         \\n         \\n         \\n         \\n         \\n         \\n         \\n         \\n         \\n         \\n         \\n         Pasco police fired 17 shots during their fatal encounter with Antonio Zambrano-Montes, according to preliminary autopsy results released during a news conference Wednesday.\\n         \\n         \\n         Three officers hit Zambrano-Montes a total of five or six times following a confrontation on Feb. 10, but none of the shots were in the back, said Kennewick Police Sgt. Ken Lattin, the spokesman for the Tri-City Special Investigations Unit.\\n         \\n         \\n         The conference was held less than two hours after a funeral service for the 35-year-old orchard worker.

His body will be transported back to Mexico, per an agreement arranged by the Mexican consulate.\\n         \\n         \\n         Before he was shot by police, Zambrano-Montes was throwing rocks at cars on the evening of Feb. 10 when officers responded. Police said he struck two officers with rocks and refused to listen to commands to surrender.\\n         \\n         \\n         Officers chased him across the street before shooting him.

       "  u'\\n             Michael Ireland was fatally shot Feb. 17 by a Springfield police officer. Southwest Missouri Cop Watchers is seeking emails police and city staffers sent about the case.\\n            \\n       \\n       After reviewing the available evidence, Greene County Prosecutor Dan Patterson determined that Springfield police officer Andrew Bath was justified in using deadly force when he shot and killed Michael Ireland on Feb. 17.\\n       \\n       \\n       \\n       governments to withhold certain information, it doesn\\'t require them to. If they want to redact information \\u2014 and can cite a specific exemption \\u2014 that\\'s fine, but they can\\'t, in my mind, turn around and charge more for the time they choose to spend providing less information.\\n       \\n       \\n       I thought the city of Springfield was on the same page \\u2014 in past conversations with City Attorney Dan Wichmer, the city has always backed off charging for redaction. But Wichmer said he thinks Wagner\\'s request is a little different.\\n       \\n       \\n       Wichmer said the review is to determine whether any of the emails contain information that would be protected by attorney-client privilege, which he said is a separate requirement outside the Sunshine Law.\\n       \\n       \\n       Wichmer said Wagner\\'s request for all emails mentioning Michael Ireland was so broad, \"it makes it very hard to say\" what might be found, justifying the 10-hour estimate.\\n       \\n       \\n       \"(The cost) is not being used to punish. I am tying up a staff person to research this,\" he said, noting that the paralegal who would do the work is the lowest-paid person qualified.\\n       \\n       \\n       Wichmer said he thinks the legal review counts as \"research time\" under the Sunshine Law.\\n       \\n       \\n       \"I was told by (staff in) the Attorney General\\'s Office in one of their seminars, you can bill for attorney-client privilege review,\" he said. \"They were very specific about that.\"\\n       \\n       \\n       That very well may have been the case. But whatever advice the state attorneys gave then, the office isn\\'t standing behind it now.\\n       \\n       \\n       When I inquired about the presentation Wichmer referenced, spokeswoman Nanci Gonder said the Attorney General\\'s Office has not taken an official position on charging for legal review.\\n       \\n       \\n       \"I\\'m not aware of any official presentations that included that,\" she said. Gonder said that, when asked, \"We basically say there\\'s no direct legal interpretation.\"\\n       \\n       \\n       Jean Maneke, the legal consultant for the Missouri Press Association, said she thinks it is clear that government bodies cannot charge for time attorneys spend reviewing and redacting records, although for a different reason than I had considered.\\n       \\n       \\n       Maneke said that, when information is closed, the law requires governments to separate it out and release the rest. If emails are protected by attorney-client privilege, the city should have separated those records already, she said, rather than waiting until a citizen requests a copy.\\n       \\n       \\n       \"That\\'s their job, that\\'s not part of the search and duplication,\" she said. \"They should have declared it closed already.\"\\n       \\n       \\n       A 2012 circuit court decision from St. Louis County that Gonder provided further undermines the argument for attorney fees.\\n       \\n       \\n       Unlike a court opinion from an appellate judge or the Missouri Supreme Court, the lower court judgment, in the case of Larry White vs. City of Ladue, isn\\'t binding in other areas of the state. But the judge, Barbara Wallace, did a nice job of explaining why charging for legal review is a bad idea.\\n       \\n       \\n       Wallace notes early on that \"(t)here are no cases interpreting if the term \\'research time\\' includes time spent by an attorney to review documents being supplied in response to a request.\" And in the specific case being dealt with, she thought that the amount the city of Ladue wanted to charge was not unreasonable.\\n       \\n       \\n       \"However, that being said, the Court is concerned that allowing governmental entities to charge for attorney review has serious potential to result in the negating of the purpose of the Sunshine Law by making it very difficult, if not impossible, for citizens to afford to exercise the rights given them under the Sunshine Law ...,\" Wallace wrote.\\n       \\n       \\n       \"Therefore, this Court determines that including attorney review time is not encompassed in research time under the statute.\"\\n       \\n       \\n       Although she sided with the citizen, Wallace wrote that the city didn\\'t appear to have purposefully violated the Sunshine Law and might have reasonably thought it could charge for the review \\u2014 especially considering that some other jurisdictions were charging similar fees.\\n       \\n       \\n       Wichmer made a similar argument. He said he\\'s been told the Attorney General\\'s Office also charges for attorney review when responding to Sunshine requests. He said he asked the Attorney General\\'s Office to clarify its policy for both of us.\\n       \\n       \\n       After I called the Attorney General\\'s Office on Wednesday and asked specifically about the policy on charging for review, attorney Patricia Churchill, the chief counsel for the governmental affairs division, sent me an email saying the office \"generally do(es) not charge requesters for responding to records requests.\"\\n       \\n       \\n       When I copied the email to Wichmer, he noted that \"use of the word \\'generally\\' does not mean never\" and said the city and the Attorney General\\'s Office \"have the same track record\" when it comes to occasionally charging for review.\\n       \\n       \\n       Whatever the case, \"everybody else is doing it\" doesn\\'t seem to be a very compelling reason for charges that get in the way of public access, especially in a case that involves a police officer killing an unarmed man. (The News-Leader has filed its own request for additional police records in the Ireland investigation, but that\\'s a story for another day).\\n       \\n       \\n       Happily, the disagreement over Wagner\\'s request for emails appears to have been resolved.\\n       \\n       \\n       After my first conversation with Wichmer, I suggested that Wagner revise her request, limiting the date range to the time of Ireland\\'s death and later and specifically excluding any emails sent by city legal staff, which would be the emails most likely to contain privileged material.\\n       \\n       \\n       The change didn\\'t immediately alter the estimate Wagner was getting from the police department. But when I called Wichmer again \\u2014 he said he hadn\\'t been told of the revised request \\u2014 the confusion was quickly addressed.\\n       \\n       \\n       \"On her new request, there shouldn\\'t be any attorney time required,\" he said.\\n       \\n       \\n       I could quibble about whether the review ever was \"required\" \\u2014 I\\'m sure it won\\'t be the last time Wichmer and I debate the finer points of the Sunshine Law \\u2014 but for now I\\'m content that Wagner can move ahead with her request at a reasonable cost.\\n       \\n       \\n       And if anyone else runs into trouble gaining access to public records, give me a call. I\\'ll review the law for you, free of charge.\\n       \\n      \\n            TIMELINE: The two minutes before the death of Michael Ireland\\n            \\n           '],\n",

He said that department policy does not allow undercover officers to not make stops, because they are not in uniform and not in marked vehicles.\\n                    \\n                    \\n                    McManus said Lee, who was in uniform, pulled behind Scott's vehicle in a marked patrol car with its lights on and both men exited their vehicles.\\n                    \\n                    \\n                    \\n                     \\n                     While we still don\\u2019t have all the details of Thursday night\\u2019s tragedy in San Antonio, what we do know is that Antronie Scott posed no threat to Officer Lee in the moments before his life was senselessly ended. Law enforcement agencies in Texas and across the country have some serious soul-searching to do. It\\u2019s not enough to insist on body cameras, training and a revision of use-of-force policies. What's required is a sea change in a law enforcement culture that shoots first and asks questions later. \\xa0The execution of unarmed men of color is a tragically\\xa0routine trend in American policing that has absolutely got to stop.\\n                     \\n                   \"],\n",

Moving forward we need to step back and give more general information, knowing that once we get the facts, we can give a more detailed statement.\\u201d\\n            \\n            \\n            Monday\\u2019s police shooting was the second in San Jose in two days.

The third suspect remains on the loose.\\n            \\n            \\n            While Cordell credits the police department for retracting the claim about Jacquez gesturing toward his waistband, she questions why the false claim was made to begin with.\\n            \\n            \\n            \\u201cIn communities of color, this is the concern, that the standard response is that \\u2018he made a furtive movement and went for something in the waist,'\\u201d she said. \\u201cWe\\u2019ve heard it a million times.
