#### a. Unarmed
(This takes the latest data from this repository (kept up to date via crontab) and generates a succinct comparison report 
for the three main racial groups in America, generated on the basis of the ‘unarmed’ variable 
(which is information as could be found on the WP website), plus statistical insight.)

#### b. Unarmed dead case not featuring an attack nor a violent crime suspect
(In progress. Beyond the mechanics in a., this involves a custom variable for which scraping and basic Natural Language Processing steps are needed, 
such as can be seen in Part I (link), under "Data Acquisition".)

(Can be found in Part II (link), under "Race profile for these groups", (2) and (2v2) respectively)
