This folder contains code for a prototype online informative app based on my project's work. (This work is an extension not present in the version of the project I delivered for the course.)

#### a. Unarmed dead cases
(This takes the latest data from this repository (kept up to date via crontab) and generates a succinct comparison report 
for the three main racial groups in America, generated on the basis of the ‘unarmed’ variable 
(which is information as could be found on the WP website), plus statistical insight.)

#### b. Unarmed dead cases not featuring an attack nor a violent crime suspect
(In progress. Beyond the mechanics in _a._, this involves a custom variable for which scraping and basic Natural Language Processing steps are needed, such as can be seen in [Part I](../Part%20I.ipynb), under "Data Acquisition".)

(The original work this is based on can be found in [Part II](../Part%20II.ipynb), under "Race profile for these groups", sections _(2)_ and _(2v2)_ respectively)
